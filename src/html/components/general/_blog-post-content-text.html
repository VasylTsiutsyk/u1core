  <h3 id="part01">Key Takeaways</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Businesses across industries are rapidly adopting AI, with
      <strong>80%</strong> already integrating it into workflows and
      <strong>52% </strong> using AI-powered tools for creative tasks.
    </li>

    <li>
      Success with AI product development requires
      <strong>strategy, ethics, and the right team setup.</strong>
    </li>

    <li>
      Artificial intelligence is a powerful assistant, but it can’t replace
      human insight.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="part02">State of Adoption in AI Product Design</h3>

  <p>
    The future of AI in design looks exciting. We’ll see more generative design,
    where AI quickly produces many design options to explore. AI co-creation is
    also on the rise, with humans and AI working together in real time to build
    better products. And with autonomous systems, AI will start to adapt and
    improve designs on its own, with little to no manual input.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shift to AI product design is already happening — and the proof is in
    the numbers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      80% of business leaders say AI is already integrated into their
      operations. AI has moved from boardroom theory to everyday workflows.
    </li>

    <li>
      61% of organizations are rethinking their data and analytics operations
      due to AI adoption. As AI becomes more embedded in workflows, companies
      are restructuring how they collect, manage, and use data to support
      smarter product design.
    </li>

    <li>
      52% of businesses use generative AI product design tools for creative
      tasks like design and content. It’s not just for tech teams — designers
      and marketers love it too.
