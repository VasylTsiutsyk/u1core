                  The future of AI in design looks exciting. We’ll see more
                  generative design, where AI quickly produces many design
                  options to explore. AI co-creation is also on the rise, with
                  humans and AI working together in real time to build better
                  products. And with autonomous systems, AI will start to adapt
                  and improve designs on its own, with little to no manual
                  input.
